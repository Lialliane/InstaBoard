# Lab 08: Instaboard

### How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

It took me around 9–10 hours total. The core React functionality came together fairly quickly since I’ve worked with React before, but I spent about 5 hours refining the styling to closely match Instagram’s interface and behavior.

### Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging?

The core functionality wasn’t difficult, but I did find it unexpectedly challenging to get the gradient border effect and like button animation to look right. The visual details took much longer than I expected, even though they seem simple at first glance.
